# DNS Management Tool README

## Description
üåê A dynamic DNS management tool built with **React.js** and **Node.js**, enabling users to üìÑ view, ‚úèÔ∏è edit, and ‚ùå delete DNS records seamlessly. This project features üîÑ real-time updates, an intuitive UI, and backend API integration for efficient DNS record management. üíª‚ú®

## Features
- Add new DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT).
- Edit existing DNS records.
- Delete unwanted DNS records.
- View all DNS records in a responsive table.
- Intuitive user interface built with React.js.
- Backend API powered by Node.js and MongoDB for data persistence.

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)
3. **npm** (comes with Node.js installation)
4. **React** (v19)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushKumar-Codes/DNS-Server-MERN-Stack.git
cd DNS-Server-MERN-Stack
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
node server.js
```
The backend server will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the `DNSHandler` directory:
```bash
cd ../DNSHandler
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend server:
```bash
npm start
```
The React.js application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Backend**: Run `server.js` in the `backend` directory to start the API server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   Make sure your MongoDB instance is running locally or modify the connection string in `server.js` to connect to a cloud database.

2. **Frontend**: Run the React.js app in the `DNSHandler` directory:
   ```bash
   cd DNSHandler
   npm start
   ```

   Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Using dig Command

To test your DNS setup locally, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dig @localhost <your-domain>
```
Replace `<your-domain>` with the domain you want to query.

## Dependencies

### Backend
- `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
- `mongoose`: ODM for MongoDB.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling CORS.
- `dgram`: UDP socket for DNS server simulation.
- `dns-packet`: Library for encoding/decoding DNS packets.

Install backend dependencies with:
```bash
npm install express mongoose cors dgram dns-packet
```

### Frontend
- `react`: UI library.
- `react-dom`: React rendering.
- `bootstrap`: For styling the table and form.

Install frontend dependencies with:
```bash
npm install react@19 react-dom@19 bootstrap
```

## Working

1. **Add a DNS Record**: Use the form to specify the hostname, record type (A, CNAME, TXT), TTL, and value.
2. **Edit a DNS Record**: Click the ‚úèÔ∏è edit button to modify a record. When done, save the changes.
3. **Delete a DNS Record**: Click the ‚ùå delete button to remove a record.
4. **Responsive UI**: The application supports all screen sizes and provides a clean, easy-to-use interface.
5. **Real-Time Updates**: Changes to records are reflected immediately in the UI.
